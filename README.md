WindyWall
Dynamic desktop wallpaper for Windows that visualizes real-time wind direction data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) or similar APIs.
Project Status
ðŸš§ Exploratory Phase: This project is currently in the planning and research stage. I am searching for existing tools that provide dynamic wallpapers based on real-time wind direction data from CMA or comparable APIs. If no suitable projects are found, I will proceed with developing this visualization tool. Contributions, suggestions, or pointers to existing solutions are welcome!
Project Overview
WindyWall aims to create a dynamic Windows desktop wallpaper that updates in real-time to display wind direction data for a user-specified location in China (or globally, if supported by the API). The wallpaper will feature a visually appealing representation of wind direction (e.g., animated arrows or streamlines) and may include additional weather metrics like wind speed.
Goals

Fetch Data: Retrieve real-time wind direction data using CMAâ€™s API (if available) or alternatives like QWeather or OpenWeatherMap.
Visualize: Generate a dynamic wallpaper with wind direction visualizations (e.g., arrows, particle animations, or wind contours).
Automate: Update the wallpaper periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes) to reflect the latest data.
Customize: Allow users to configure location, visualization style, and update frequency.

Potential Features

Wind direction arrows or particle-based animations.
Support for multiple cities or regions.
Configurable background colors and visualization styles.
Optional display of wind speed, temperature, or other weather data.
Lightweight and efficient to minimize system resource usage.

Research Plan
Before development begins, I will:

Search GitHub, Google, and other platforms for existing projects that:
Create dynamic wallpapers using real-time wind direction data.
Integrate with CMA or similar meteorological APIs.


Evaluate CMAâ€™s API availability and documentation. If unavailable, explore alternatives like:
QWeather (supports CMA data).
OpenWeatherMap.
MeteoSwiss or other open-data sources.


If no existing tools meet the requirements, proceed with:
Selecting a programming language (likely Python for its ecosystem).
Designing the visualization approach (e.g., Pillow for static images, Pygame for animations).
Planning Windows integration (e.g., using ctypes for wallpaper updates).



Current Findings:

daspartho/dynamic-wallpaper: Changes wallpapers based on weather conditions using OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash APIs, but does not focus on wind direction or CMA data.
pgaskin/windy: An Android live wallpaper visualizing wind patterns from NOAA GFS data, not Windows-compatible or CMA-specific.
No projects found yet that specifically use CMA wind data for Windows dynamic wallpapers.

Next Steps:

Confirm CMA API access or select an alternative.
Update this README with research outcomes and development plans.

Getting Started
This project is not yet in active development. If youâ€™re interested in contributing or have information about existing solutions, please:

Check the Issues section for discussions or to share findings.
Open a new issue to suggest APIs, visualization ideas, or related projects.

Prerequisites (Planned)

Python 3.8+ (for development).
API key for CMA, QWeather, or another weather service.
Windows 10/11 (for wallpaper integration).

Installation (To Be Added)
Once development begins, installation instructions will include:

Cloning the repository.
Installing dependencies (requests, Pillow, etc.).
Configuring API keys and location settings.

Usage (To Be Added)
Example usage will be provided, such as:
python windywall.py --location "Beijing" --api-key "your-api-key"

This will generate and set a dynamic wallpaper showing Beijingâ€™s real-time wind direction.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome, especially during this exploratory phase! You can help by:

Sharing links to existing projects or APIs.
Suggesting visualization techniques or libraries.
Providing feedback on the projectâ€™s direction.

To contribute:

Fork the repository.
Create a branch (git checkout -b feature/idea).
Commit changes (git commit -m "Add suggestion for X").
Push to the branch (git push origin feature/idea).
Open a Pull Request.

Please follow the Code of Conduct (to be added).
Roadmap

 Research existing projects and APIs.
 Confirm API selection and access.
 Define visualization design (static vs. animated).
 Develop initial prototype.
 Add user configuration options.
 Optimize performance and release v1.0.

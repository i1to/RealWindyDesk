# WindyWall

Dynamic desktop wallpaper for Windows that visualizes real-time wind direction data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) or similar APIs.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Exploratory Phase**: This project is currently in the planning and research stage. I am searching for existing tools that provide dynamic wallpapers based on real-time wind direction data from CMA or comparable APIs. If no suitable projects are found, I will proceed with developing this visualization tool. Contributions, suggestions, or pointers to existing solutions are welcome!

## Project Overview

WindyWall aims to create a dynamic Windows desktop wallpaper that updates in real-time to display wind direction data for a user-specified location in China (or globally, if supported by the API). The wallpaper will feature a visually appealing representation of wind direction (e.g., animated arrows or streamlines) and may include additional weather metrics like wind speed.

### Goals
- **Fetch Data**: Retrieve real-time wind direction data using CMAâ€™s API (if available) or alternatives like QWeather or OpenWeatherMap.
- **Visualize**: Generate a dynamic wallpaper with wind direction visualizations (e.g., arrows, particle animations, or wind contours).
- **Automate**: Update the wallpaper periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes) to reflect the latest data.
- **Customize**: Allow users to configure location, visualization style, and update frequency.

### Potential Features
- Wind direction arrows or particle-based animations.
- Support for multiple cities or regions.
- Configurable background colors and visualization styles.
- Optional display of wind speed, temperature, or other weather data.
- Lightweight and efficient to minimize system resource usage.

## Research Plan

Before development begins, I will:
1. Search GitHub, Google, and other platforms for existing projects that:
   - Create dynamic wallpapers using real-time wind direction data.
   - Integrate with CMA or similar meteorological APIs.
2. Evaluate CMAâ€™s API availability and documentation. If unavailable, explore alternatives like:
   - [QWeather](https://dev.qweather.com/) (supports CMA data).
   - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
   - [MeteoSwiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/) or other open-data sources.
3. If no existing tools meet the requirements, proceed with:
   - Selecting a programming language (likely Python for its ecosystem).
   - Designing the visualization approach (e.g., Pillow for static images, Pygame for animations).
   - Planning Windows integration (e.g., using `ctypes` for wallpaper updates).

**Current Findings**:
- [daspartho/dynamic-wallpaper](https://github.com/daspartho/dynamic-wallpaper): Changes wallpapers based on weather conditions using OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash APIs, but does not focus on wind direction or CMA data.[](https://github.com/daspartho/dynamic-wallpaper)
- [pgaskin/windy](https://github.com/pgaskin/windy): An Android live wallpaper visualizing wind patterns from NOAA GFS data, not Windows-compatible or CMA-specific.[](https://github.com/pgaskin/windy)
- No projects found yet that specifically use CMA wind data for Windows dynamic wallpapers.

**Next Steps**:
- Confirm CMA API access or select an alternative.
- Update this README with research outcomes and development plans.

## Getting Started

This project is not yet in active development. If youâ€™re interested in contributing or have information about existing solutions, please:
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/windywall/issues) section for discussions or to share findings.
- Open a new issue to suggest APIs, visualization ideas, or related projects.

### Prerequisites (Planned)
- Python 3.8+ (for development).
- API key for CMA, QWeather, or another weather service.
- Windows 10/11 (for wallpaper integration).

### Installation (To Be Added)
Once development begins, installation instructions will include:
1. Cloning the repository.
2. Installing dependencies (`requests`, `Pillow`, etc.).
3. Configuring API keys and location settings.

## Usage (To Be Added)
Example usage will be provided, such as:
```bash
python windywall.py --location "Beijing" --api-key "your-api-key"
```
This will generate and set a dynamic wallpaper showing Beijingâ€™s real-time wind direction.
